Use Terraform to deploy a virtual network, subnets, and public IP addresses to Azure.

Use Terraform to create a game development staging environment in Azure that consists of the following resources:

Multiple virtual machines running a game development environment like Unity or Unreal Engine
A load balancer to distribute traffic among the virtual machines
A file server for storing code repositories and other development artifacts
A database server for storing data used in development and testing
An Azure DevOps project for managing the development process, including version control, build and release pipelines, and work tracking
Use Terraform to install and configure the necessary software on the virtual machines, file server, and database server. This could involve using the remote-exec provisioner to run shell scripts or using the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) provisioner to run Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI scripts.

Use Terraform to set up a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for the game development staging environment. This could involve configuring the Azure DevOps project with a Git repository and build and release pipelines, and setting up a staging environment for testing.

Configure monitoring and alerting for the game development staging environment and infrastructure. This could involve using Azure Monitor to set up alerts based on performance metrics and log data, and integrating with a notification service like Azure Notification Hubs or Slack.

Use Terraform to automate the deployment of the game development
